This is a demo minisite I created according to the specifications in a want ad. You can see a functioning version of the site at http://octagon-sample.herokuapp.com. (There is one difference between that site and the code presented here: this code uses SQLite, the herokuapp site uses PostgreSQL, since Heroku doesn't support SQLite).
It was written using Ruby on Rails. The site has four pages: a landing page, a contact creation page, a contact index page (which will display a list of all contacts made; when the site is first started up, this will be empty), and a contact display page (which displays a single contact).
I used one gem to simplify matters: the simple_form gem, which makes creating forms less verbose.
