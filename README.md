This is a demo minisite I created according to the specifications in a want ad. It was written using Ruby on Rails. The site has four pages: a landing page, a contact creation page, a contact index page (which will display a list of all contacts made; when the site is first started up, this will be empty), and a contact display page (which displays a single contact).
I used one gem to simplify matters: the simple_form gem, which makes creating forms less verbose.
